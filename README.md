# NoCast
> Where light does not reach, darkness reigns.

## What is this?
NoCast is an alternative to the * AWESOME* [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) available only on MacOS.
It's written in Rust, with a plugin system for javascript plugins (using [rustyscript](https://github.com/rscarson/rustyscript/)).

## Installation
Currently, the only way to install this is building it from source. To do it you need [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/),
which you can install with [the normal Rust installation](https://rustup.rs/).

## Creating plugins
Right now, we're working on a guide for plugin developers. While we're working on it, you can learn how plugins work
by seing how the core plugins function.
